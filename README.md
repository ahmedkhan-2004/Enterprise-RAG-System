## Overview

The **Enterprise RAG System** is a **production-ready AI document Q&A platform** developed for **Dasseti** while I was a **Junior AI Application Developer**.  

This system leverages **.NET 8**, **Semantic Kernel**, and **Elasticsearch** to provide **intelligent, scalable, and secure document query capabilities** for enterprise clients. Users can ask questions over large document collections and receive **context-aware, accurate responses in real-time**.

## My Role

As a **Junior AI Application Developer**, I was responsible for:  

- Implementing **Semantic Kernel-based document retrieval and reasoning**.  
- Integrating **Elasticsearch for high-performance indexing and search**.  
- Ensuring **security best practices**, removing sensitive secrets, and managing placeholders for production deployment.  
- Collaborating on **production-ready architecture**, CI/CD workflows, and deployment pipelines.  
- Writing **clean, maintainable, and modular code** for enterprise usage.  

This experience gave me **hands-on exposure to building enterprise AI systems**, production deployment, and real-world problem-solving.
